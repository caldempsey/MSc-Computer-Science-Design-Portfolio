    <div class = "center"><p><b>This index.html is not the intended submission, I urge you to please read along!</b></p></div><p>Good evening COMP1026 examiners,</p>
<p>As Matthew is aware I have encountered incompatibility issues with the object tag and Javascript functions I have tried to pass through it: that is the object tag fails to update the content of the interactive window consistently where iframes do not fail thereto. Consequently that website will not validate in xHTML (because of the use of iframes). To that end I have prepared three presets of the same website.</p><p> First of these is option A (in directory evolution_primary) which was the originally intended submission for the purposes of grading: featuring Javascript error handling whereby if the user has Javascript enabled the page is outright transformed into a much more fluid feeling and much faster loading page on servers that support Javascript. Unfortunately the www.personal.leeds.ac.uk webpage does NOT support Javascript, as informed by the ISS helpdesk. This issue is serverside, not clientside: you may observe how Javascript calls jQuery functions correctly but fails to pass them, forcing it to reiterate over the same function until called, crashing the browser. So it is impossible for my detection methods to pick up (since they run on Javascript and if Javascript is enabled in browser then it tries to run functions the server will not pass). Otherwise the website appears compatibile with all browsers. Therefore, if you are to browse the first option from personal.leeds.ac.uk I urge you to disable Javascript in your browsers (enabling the sites Accessibility mode feature) or run the website package locally or see the website of Option A running via a different host.</p><p>Option B on the other hand (in directory evolution_secondary) does not obtain so many Javascript features (the iframe function has been removed) and has been made thereto fully xHTML authenticated. Changes are as follows: discontinued the use of THE iframe class, so all websites do not load quickly in index.html; changed use of java.js to java_secondary; and removed accessibility function consequently (no longer necessary since no iframes other than those authenticated by Matthew (chat and videos, although please note Matthew authenticated the iFrame swap which takes place in Option A's index.html).</p><p>However Option B as well as Option A employs Javascript to some end, so is incompatible with the domain specified for the requirements of the module. For this please try Option C, where all incompatible Javascript features are stripped. The only significant change from Option B is that the mock user-authentication feature has been removed. </p><p>Option A's accessibility mode which runs when Javascript is disabled appears to be ideal for text-based browsers (since it is easier to browse the content than having to scroll through the index.</p><p> After the submission deadline passes sufficiently I will upload Option A to hosting resource www.pythonanywhere.com which will allow me to implement the Django/Java features I originally intended.</p><br/><p> Time for a break <!--"HURR" --> </p><p>With that said I would like to say something: I would like to extend a warm thank you to both the postgraduate students, tutors, and persons within the class, all whom of which have completed a truly wonderful learning experience. To that end I never understood both the capacity I had to read, optimize, and implement highly complex code amidst what I was capable of as an academic. Completing these modules, I have found an understanding of volumous ideas to be so much more fluent. That is, these modules have raised my essay grades,  my confidence in my programming, and in myself. You would do well to know before I entered the COMP modules I was a lowley nerd who could barely program his Minecraft server at the mental-age of sixteen. To illustrate those abilities look back at <a href = "python.py">my first ever assignment for COMP1036</a>. For the first time in University I really have felt like I have achieved something a little bit more than academic value. I've found something new in life to obtain a passion for. If it weren't for my desire to become I lawyer I'd be wishing I had taken a Computer Science degree 'program'. That influence is something you should be proud of and I could never have done it without you.</p><p> Unfortunately I forsee this being my last COMP module. I just wanted to say something. Like I wanted to create Java based user authentication features, <a href = "python2.py">like I wanted to invent a regex controllers and write post-process initialization for my Python search engine</a>. I always wanted to create <em>something</em> because something always <em>felt</em> better than nothing - and was always enjoyed.</p> <p>Find me helping users on StackOverflow.com and Happy Learning!</p>
<p>Your friend,</p><p>
